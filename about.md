Hi there and welcome! My name is Sebastian Banescu and this is my private homepage. 

I am currently a PhD student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. You can find more details about my research interests from my official TUM [homepage](https://www22.in.tum.de/banescu/). For more details about my background, here is my [CV](https://github.com/banescusebi/europecv2013/raw/master/CV-Sebastian-Banescu.pdf).
